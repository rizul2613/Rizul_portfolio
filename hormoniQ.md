HormoniQ
UI/UX Case Study


Project Overview: 
HormoniQ is a hormonal health tracking app designed to help users monitor their period cycle, mood, energy levels, and sleep. The app also offers community support and personalized insights to enhance user well-being. My role in this project was to design an intuitive, user-friendly experience that ensures accessibility and engagement.


Problem Statement 
Many individuals struggle to understand and manage their hormonal health due to a lack of structured, easy-to-use digital tools. The goal of HormoniQ was to create an app that provides seamless tracking, actionable insights, and community engagement while maintaining an empathetic and visually appealing interface.


UX Research:


1. User Research Summary
	Objective:
To understand user needs, pain points, and expectations related to hormonal health tracking.
	Methodology:
•	Conducted a questionnaire with 5 respondents.
•	Targeted women of different age groups and lifestyles.
•	Focused on period tracking, mood/energy monitoring, sleep habits, and community support.
 
	Key Findings:
1.	Tracking Needs – Users want accurate cycle predictions with insights on mood and energy changes.
2.	Community Support – Many users expressed the need for a safe space to discuss hormonal health.
3.	Privacy Concerns – Users are concerned about data security in existing apps.
4.	Feature Requests – Interest in wearable integration, AI-driven insights, and wellness recommendations.
2. Competitor Analysis (Flo vs. HormoniQ)
	Strengths of Flo:
A well-known & trusted brand
AI-powered period & ovulation tracking
Rich content on women’s health

	Limitations of Flo:
It focuses specifically on fertility rather than hormonal health
Some users find it overloaded with features & notifications
Privacy concerns around data sharing.

	How HormoniQ Stands Out:
A brief approach (tracking mood, energy, and sleep along with periods)
A dedicated community space for users to share experiences
Stronger focus on privacy & security with encrypted data storage

Wireframing & Prototyping
•	Created wireframes to map out the app’s user flow.
•	Developed interactive high-fidelity prototypes using Figma.
•	Ensured a clean, minimalistic design with a focus on accessibility (color contrast, typography, and intuitive navigation).
